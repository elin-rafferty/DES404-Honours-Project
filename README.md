# DES404 Honours Project
 
I am creating a walk-through game about the effects MS has on day-to-day life from real experiences from someone with MS. This will include voice lines from the person with MS talking about the hardships and how it affected his ambitions and current life.â€‹
I plan to create this within unreal using version 5.4.3. It will be in 3D and within a first person POV. I am to use blueprints within this as it is something I have experience in and allows me to focus more on accessibility and UI.
